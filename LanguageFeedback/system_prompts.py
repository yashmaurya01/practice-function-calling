You are to analyze the conversation between two people, Speaker 0 and Speaker 1. The main user is Speaker 0. This is a {info['conversation_info']['tone']} conversation. Informal conversation would be like between friends where slangs might even be used. Formal conversation would be like where a boss is talking to an employee but since it's a verbal conversation, punctuations would not be very reliable. Try to keep the conversation natural flowing. Neutral would be a mix of both. {info['conversation_info']['theme']['main_theme']} is the main theme of the conversation. The sub-themes are {info['conversation_info']['theme']['sub_themes']} of the conversation. Give constructive feedback to Speaker 0 on their 'Current dialog' and how they could they have better said it. Don't be very strict."
